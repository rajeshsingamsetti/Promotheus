Its An monitoring tool
provides metrics & alerting
its flexible query launguage

it collects metrics from monitor targets by scraping metrics http endpoints

Installation.

ref url: https://github.com/in4it/prometheus-course

take ubuntu 18.04 + launch instance + 
login as a root

git clone https://github.com/in4it/prometheus-course.git

cd  prometheus-course
cd scripts

we need to install this three scripts.

./1-install.sh
after check promothus install or not 
ps aux | grep prometheus

in chrome
ipaddress:9090/graph

under execute we will see that execute metrics(it will there in default)

For nice dashboards purpose we are using grafana

cd scripts
./3-install-grafana.sh

ps aux | grep grafana

inchrome:
ipaddress:3000/login
username: admin
password: admin

go to settings --> configurations --> data sources --> add data source

name: promothues
type: promothues

url: http://localhost:9090
aceess (default)

click on save and test


now go to side menu + plus icon + create + create dashboard + choose graph + edit +

under below metrics tab + choose promethues + copy and paste the (sample script of promethues metrics) what we created
it will create the graph what it will had in promethues + same graph it will show in grafana (grafana for better visualization)


Basic concepts:

all data stored in as time series
every time series identify by the metric name

** Promethues configuration:

cat /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml

it will store Promethues configuraton file its in yml format

here we will configuere
job name and targets like https://localhost:9090


==================monitoring nodes(servers)=====================================
for this we need to install node exporter(like cpu usuage)

./2-node-exporter.sh

vi /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
